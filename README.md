# Inato `fp-ts` training

This repo is a work in progress toward having a comprehensive training material
to onboard people on using `fp-ts` efficiently.

The exercices consist of unimplemented functions and their associated failing
tests.

To run the tests, simply run
```sh
$ yarn test
```

You can also run them in watch mode:
```sh
$ yarn test:watch
```

Finally, if you wish to only run the tests for a given exercice `exoN`, you can
run the following:
```sh
$ yarn test[:watch] exoN
```

The exercices are organized into `exoN` folders and most of what is required to
complete each is detailed in the comments.
